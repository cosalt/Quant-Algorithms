# Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)

Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) is a multi-factor asset pricing model that provides a more flexible alternative to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Developed by economist Stephen Ross in 1976, APT posits that an asset's expected return can be modeled as a linear function of various macroeconomic factors or theoretical market indices.

Unlike the CAPM, which assumes that the single factor of market risk is sufficient to explain returns, APT allows for multiple sources of systematic risk. Crucially, APT does not specify *what* these factors must be. This flexibility is both a strength and a challenge of the model, as it requires quants to use statistical methods (like factor analysis) to identify the relevant risk factors for a given set of assets.

## The Formula

The expected return of an asset is a linear combination of its sensitivity to several risk factors:

$$
E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_{i1} F_1 + \beta_{i2} F_2 + \dots + \beta_{in} F_n
$$

## Components of the Formula

-   **$E(R_i)$**: The **expected return** of the investment.
-   **$R_f$**: The **risk-free rate** of return.
-   **$F_1, F_2, \dots, F_n$**: A set of **systematic risk factors**. Each factor ($F_k$) represents the risk premium associated with that factor (i.e., the expected return of a portfolio with a beta of 1 for that factor and 0 for all others). Common examples of factors include:
    -   Unexpected changes in inflation.
    -   Unexpected changes in industrial production or GDP.
    -   Changes in the yield curve (the spread between long-term and short-term interest rates).
    -   Unexpected changes in investor confidence.
-   **$\beta_{i1}, \beta_{i2}, \dots, \beta_{in}$**: The **factor betas** for the asset. Each beta ($\beta_{ik}$) measures the sensitivity of the asset's return to the corresponding risk factor ($F_k$).

## Python Implementation Example

The implementation of APT requires a list of factor premiums and a corresponding list of the asset's betas for those factors. The calculation then becomes a sum of the products of the betas and their respective factor premiums, added to the risk-free rate.

```python
def calculate_apt(risk_free_rate, factor_premiums, factor_betas):
    """
    Calculates the expected return of an asset using the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT).

    Args:
        risk_free_rate (float): The risk-free rate of return.
        factor_premiums (list of float): A list of the risk premiums for each systematic factor.
        factor_betas (list of float): A list of the asset's betas corresponding to each factor.

    Returns:
        float: The expected return of the asset, or None if the input lists are mismatched.
    """
    if len(factor_premiums) != len(factor_betas):
        print("Error: The number of factor premiums must match the number of factor betas.")
        return None

    # Calculate the sum of the products of betas and factor premiums
    risk_premium_sum = sum(beta * premium for beta, premium in zip(factor_betas, factor_premiums))
    
    expected_return = risk_free_rate + risk_premium_sum
    return expected_return

# --- Example Usage ---
# Given:
# Risk-Free Rate
rf = 0.03

# Define the systematic factors and their risk premiums
# Factor 1: Unexpected Inflation Premium
# Factor 2: GDP Growth Premium
# Factor 3: Yield Curve Steepness Premium
premiums = [0.02, 0.035, 0.01] 

# Define the betas of a specific company with respect to these factors
# For example, a company highly sensitive to GDP but not to inflation
betas = [0.2, 1.4, 0.5]

# Calculate expected return
expected_asset_return = calculate_apt(
    risk_free_rate=rf,
    factor_premiums=premiums,
    factor_betas=betas
)

if expected_asset_return is not None:
    print(f"Expected Return (APT): {expected_asset_return:.4f}")

# Expected output: Expected Return (APT): 0.0880
# Calculation: 0.03 + (0.2 * 0.02) + (1.4 * 0.035) + (0.5 * 0.01) = 0.088

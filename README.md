# Quantitative Finance Algorithms & Models

Welcome to my quantitative finance repository! This project serves as my personal journey into the world of financial models, algorithms, and quantitative analysis.

## Purpose of This Repository

The primary goal of this repository is to learn, implement, and document various quantitative finance models. By building these algorithms from scratch, I aim to develop a deeper understanding of the mathematical theories and practical applications that drive modern finance.

This space is for experimentation, learning, and creating a personal library of financial tools.

## Models Implemented

Here you will find implementations and explanations for various models. Each model will have its own detailed documentation.

-   **[The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)](./capm/README.md)**: A foundational model for determining the expected return on an asset based on its systematic risk.

*More models and algorithms will be added as I continue to explore the field.*

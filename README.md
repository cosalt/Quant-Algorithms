# Quantitative Finance Algorithms & Models

Welcome to my quantitative finance repository! This project serves as my personal journey into the world of financial models, algorithms, and quantitative analysis.

## Purpose of This Repository

The primary goal of this repository is to learn, implement, and document various quantitative finance models. By building these algorithms from scratch, I aim to develop a deeper understanding of the mathematical theories and practical applications that drive modern finance.

This space is for experimentation, learning, and creating a personal library of financial tools.

## Models Implemented

Here you will find implementations and explanations for various models. Each model will have its own detailed documentation.

-   **[The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)](https://github.com/cosalt/Quant-Algorithms/tree/main/CAPM-Model)**: A foundational model for determining the expected return on an asset based on its systematic risk.
-   **[The Fama-French Three-Factor Model](https://github.com/cosalt/Quant-Algorithms/tree/main/Fama-French%20Three-Factor%20Model)**: An extension of the CAPM that adds size (SMB) and value (HML) risk factors to better explain stock returns.
-   **[The Carhart Four-Factor Model](https://github.com/cosalt/Quant-Algorithms/tree/main/Carhart%20Four-Factor%20Model)**: Builds on the Fama-French model by including a fourth risk factor for momentum (MOM).
-   **[Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)](https://github.com/cosalt/Quant-Algorithms/tree/main/Arbitrage%20Pricing%20Theory%20(APT))**: A flexible multi-factor model that explains asset returns using various macroeconomic or theoretical risk sources.

*More models and algorithms will be added as I continue to explore the field.*
